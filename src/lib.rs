//! This crate provides collections (sets and maps) that wrap [SmallVec].
//!
//! # Use cases
//!
//! ## Small collections
//!
//! It happens very frequently that you have collections that have on average just a very small number of elements. If you know
//! the maximum size or even the maximum _typical_ size in advance, you can use this crate to store such collections without allocations.
//! For a larger number of elements, the underlying [SmallVec] will allocate the elements on the heap as a single allocation.
//!
//! ## Read-heavy collections
//!
//! Another very frequent pattern is that you have a possibly large collection that is being created once and then used readonly for
//! a long time. E.g. lookup tables. In these cases, ease of adding individual new elements is less important than compact in-memory
//! representation and lookup performance. This crate provides succinct collections that have only a very small constant overhead over
//! the contents of the collections.
//!
//! # Performance
//!
//! Performance for bulk creation as well as lookup is better than [BTreeMap]/[BTreeSet] and comparable with [HashMap]/[HashSet] for
//! types with a cheap [Ord] instance, like primitive types, and small to medium sizes. Performance for insertion or removal of
//! individual elements to/from large collections is bad, however. This is not the intended use case.
//!
//! # Collections overview
//!
//! ## [VecSet]
//!
//! Provides a set backed by a [SmallVec] of elements.
//!
//! ## [VecMap]
//!
//! Provides a map backed by a [SmallVec] of key value pairs.
//!
//! ## [TotalVecSet]
//!
//! A [VecSet] with an additional flag so it can support negation. This way it is possible to represent e.g. the set of all u64 except 1.
//!
//! ## [TotalVecMap]
//!
//! A [VecMap] with an additional default value, so lookup is a total function.
//!
//! # Unsafe
//!
//! The in place operations use unsafe code. If that is a problem for you, let me know and I can hide them behind a feature.
